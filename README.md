# 2-Genes-Comparison
I was asked by a genome medical doctor to develop a program to make it easier for him to find the common genes in 2 excel files from 2 different persons, after that I provided the full information that is already given from the excel files of that common gene from both sides(Husband and Wife).
With the help of this block of code, its now easy to detect common genes and compare the mutations between the 2 sets of data (Husband & Wife) as after the common gene is found, the program finds the gene in both ends and extracts the data of that row to 2 new seperate files, which then the user(Doctor) can just read and check and detect any mutations.
